# Predicting Insurance Risk Rating of Automobiles
The core of this project revolves around two primary analytical methods: Classification Model and clustering. The predicted rating is an assessment of the likelihood that an insurer will have to pay out a claim and the potential cost of that claim
Each car is given a risk factor symbol associated with its price. This symbol is an integer value that can range typically from -3 to +3. The value reflects the car's riskiness in terms of insurance:
* +3: Indicates a car is considered risky to insure.
* 0: Represents an average risk.
* -3: Suggests the car is deemed safer than average

# Objective
This comprehensive project harnesses advanced data science techniques to empower insurance managers with predictive insights into automobile insurance risk ratings, fostering informed decision-making for optimized premium strategies. By merging predictive modeling with clustering analysis, the project illuminates how vehicle attributes like engine size, horsepower, and dimensions correlate with insurance risk, guiding industry leaders in tailoring risk assessment and customer engagement practices.

# Data Acquistion
The dataset I've used is sourced from Kaggle's called "Automobile Dataset". It contains a broad spectrum of variables, ranging from basic car attributes like make and body style to more technical aspects including engine size, horsepower, and price. The variables are a mix of categorical and numerical types, presenting an opportunity to explore diverse analytical techniques.

# Steps taken to build the models
* Data Exploration
* Data Preparation
* Modelling
* Model Evaluation
* Model Selection
* Model Fine-Tuning

# Results and Insights
The classification model's ability to predict risk ratings with high accuracy is a beneficial for insurance managers. This predictive prowess facilitates better risk assessments, paving the way for more accurate premium calculations. The Random Forest model's feature importance graph highlights key attributes affecting vehicle insurance risk ratings

The clustering model segments vehicles into distinct groups based on their characteristics. It is seen that the riskiest automobiles are those that have moderate dimensions, engine size, mileage, price, and horsepower. Insurers should design higher premiums and strict policies for such automobiles. Moreover, the safest cars are those with largest dimensions, engine size, bore, stroke, horsepower, highest price, and lowest mileage
